# Simple Calorie Tracker

A simplified calorie tracker with over-time analytics tools.

Built in flutter \(dart\) with Android in mind as the build target.

Support for multiple languages: (English, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese)

This app exists to track only the calories you consume for the day, with the philosophy that entering individual foods
is a waste of time for those who are simply trying to maintain a certain level of calorie intake - and that calorie
look-up through listed nutrition facts or a quick google search is more than enough. 


For those who are frustrated by apps that make tracking your daily intake a chore.


CICO.

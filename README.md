# Simple Calorie Tracker

A very simple calorie tracker with over-time analytics tools (in development).

Built in flutter \(dart\) with Android in mind as the build target.

This app exists to track only the calories you consume for the day, with the philosophy that entering individual foods
is a waste of time for those who are simply trying to maintain a certain level of calorie intake - and that calorie
look-up through listed nutrition facts or a quick google search is more than enough. 


This app is for those who are frustrated by apps that make tracking your daily intake a chore.
